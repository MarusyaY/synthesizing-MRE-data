Three models to simulate wave propagation inside 2D slice of phantom and brain (master thesis project)

Coupled harmonic oscillator (CHO) method of generating diaplacement in the tissues due to wave propagation was firstly introduced in 2001 [1]. It is based on solving differential equation for a system of coupled harmonic oscillators.

The K-Wave is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that includes functions capable of simulation wave propagation in homogeneous or heterogeneous medium in either 1-, 2- or 3D. [2]
